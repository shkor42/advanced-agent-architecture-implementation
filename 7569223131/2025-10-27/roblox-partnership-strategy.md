4. **"We can prove value in 90 days with minimal risk"**

### Anticipated Questions & Responses

#### Technical Questions
**Q:** "How do you ensure data privacy for children?"
**A:** "We process only avatar metadata, no personal information. All models trained on anonymized data and comply with COPPA."

**Q:** "How does this integrate with existing algorithms?"
**A:** "We sit as a layer on top, enhancing rather than replacing current systems. Easy API integration."

**Q:** "What's the computational overhead?"
**A:** "Minimal - profiling is done client-side, recommendations are pre-computed and cached."

#### Business Questions
**Q:** "Why should Roblox pay for this?"
**A:** "Direct revenue uplift from increased engagement and premium conversions. Conservative estimate: $5M/month additional revenue."

**Q:** "How do we measure success?"
**A:** "Clear KPIs: conversion rate uplift, retention increase, parent satisfaction scores. 30-day pilot with defined success metrics."

**Q:** "What happens if it doesn't work?"
**A:** "Pilot includes performance guarantees. If we don't hit 20% conversion uplift, no payment required."
