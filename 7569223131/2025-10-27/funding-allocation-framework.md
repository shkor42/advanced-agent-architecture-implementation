# Collective Intelligence Labs: Funding Allocation Framework

## Executive Summary

Quarterly investment distribution model designed to fund high-potential projects while maintaining team alignment and performance accountability. Framework focuses on simplicity in Phase 1 with scalable complexity for future growth.

## Core Principles

### Investment Philosophy
1. **Merit-Based Allocation:** Projects with higher contribution percentages receive proportionally larger funding
2. **Quarterly Cadence:** Regular distribution ensures continuous project support and accountability
3. **Revenue Share Alignment:** Projects commit percentage of future revenue to collective pool
4. **Performance-Driven:** Underperforming projects have structured exit mechanisms

### Funding Pool Structure
```
Total Quarterly Investment: $100,000
├── Quarterly Allocation Pool: 20% ($20,000)
├── Operations Reserve: 30% ($30,000)  
├── Emergency Fund: 25% ($25,000)
└── Strategic Initiatives: 25% ($25,000)
```

## Project Lifecycle Management

### Phase 1: Declaration
**Timeline:** First week of quarter
**Requirements:**
- Project submission with 2% revenue commitment
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Team resource requirements
- Success metrics definition

**Submission Template:**
```markdown
## Project Proposal - [Project Name]

### Overview
[Project description and problem statement]

### Technical Requirements
[Development resources, infrastructure needs]

### Team Commitment
[Core team members, time allocation]

### Revenue Commitment
2% of project revenue to collective pool

### Success Metrics
[3-5 measurable KPIs]

### Timeline
[Key milestones and delivery dates]
```

### Phase 2: Validation
**Timeline:** Second week of quarter
**Validation Committee:**
- 3 Core members (majority vote)
- 1 Associate member (advisory vote)
- External advisor (if required)

**Validation Criteria:**
- ✅ Technical feasibility (30% weight)
- ✅ Market opportunity (25% weight)
- ✅ Team capability (20% weight)
- ✅ Revenue potential (15% weight)
- ✅ Strategic alignment (10% weight)

### Phase 3: Funding Distribution
**Timeline:** Third week of quarter
**Distribution Formula:**
```
Project Allocation = Quarterly Pool × (Project Contribution % ÷ Total Project Contributions %)
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Quarterly Pool: $20,000
Project A: 2% contribution
Project B: 2% contribution  
Project C: 1% contribution

Total Contributions: 5%

Project A: $20,000 × (2% ÷ 5%) = $8,000
Project B: $20,000 × (2% ÷ 5%) = $8,000  
Project C: $20,000 × (1% ÷ 5%) = $4,000
```

### Phase 4: Performance Monitoring
**Timeline:** Throughout quarter
**Monthly Reviews:**
- Progress against milestones
- Budget utilization analysis
- KPI performance tracking
- Resource allocation adjustments

**Quarterly Performance Report:**
